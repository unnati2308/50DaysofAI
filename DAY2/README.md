# Different Libraries in Python:
## 1. Pandas (Data Manipulation)
**Purpose: Handling and analyzing structured data.**
**Key Features:**
Create and manage DataFrames and Series.
Data cleaning (handling missing values, duplicates).
Data aggregation, grouping, and merging.
File handling (CSV, Excel, JSON, SQL, etc.).

## 2. NumPy (Numerical Computation)
**Purpose: Efficient numerical operations on large datasets.**
**Key Features:**
Support for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.
High-performance mathematical functions (e.g., linear algebra, Fourier transforms).
Basis for other libraries like Pandas and SciPy.

## 3. Matplotlib (Data Visualization)
**Purpose: Create static, interactive, and animated visualizations.**
**Key Features:**
Customizable plots (line, bar, scatter, etc.).
Fine control over plot aesthetics (titles, labels, legends).
Export to various file formats.

## 4. Seaborn (Advanced Data Visualization)
**Purpose: High-level interface for attractive, informative graphics.**
**Key Features:**
Built on top of Matplotlib for enhanced visuals.
Simplifies statistical plotting (pair plots, heatmaps, etc.).
Works seamlessly with Pandas DataFrames.
